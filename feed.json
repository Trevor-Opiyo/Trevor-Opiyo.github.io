After reading numerous headlines about large data breaches I began to research better ways to store passwords and two password managers stood out to me for having the best security practices. In my experience <a href=\"https://bitwarden.com\">Bitwarden</a> and <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/use-keychains-to-store-passwords-mchlf375f392/mac\">Safari Keychain</a> were the simplest and most secure ways to store non-reused passwords between devices. Between the two I use Bitwarden, who's <a href=\"https://bitwarden.com/download/ \">software compatibility</a>, and <a href=\"https://bitwarden.com/images/resources/security-white-paper-2021.pdf\">AES-256 bit encryption</a> stood out to me amongst its competitors.</p><p>After choosing and configuring a password manager, I found that the password generator included in the password manager did not make acceptable passwords for of the many websites and services that required a new password. Bitwarden's password generator offered too little granularity in password creation. The only options were toggles for special characters(%-#&amp; , etc.) and integers. Other password managers on the internet provided too much granularity in password creation, with configurability that would allow for the creation of passwords that could be cracked in polynomial time. Inclusion of questions such as \"How many numbers would you like to include in the password?\" disappointed me, by limiting the number of permutations of the password that may be generated.</p><p>Eventually, I decided to write my own password generator that met my personal criteria in terms of security and variability and to serve as an exercise in learning about programming language standard libraries and syntax. The programming languages that I chose to implement the project are <a href=\"https://github.com/Trevor-Opiyo/java-passmaker\">Java</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/Trevor-Opiyo/python-passmaker\">Python</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/Trevor-Opiyo/go-passmaker\">Go</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/Trevor-Opiyo/rust-passmaker\">Rust</a>, and <a href=\"https://github.com/Trevor-Opiyo/swift-passmaker\">Swift</a>. I knew initially that all implementations of Passmaker should attempt to account for two prominent security criteria; The random library used to generate the passwords must be cryptographically random, and the passwords must contain the highest amount of variability during password generation. Examples of cryptographically secure libraries include <a href=\"https://crates.io/crates/rand_chacha\">rand chacha</a>, in rust and <a href=\"https://pkg.go.dev/crypto/rand\">rand</a> in go and are instrumental in ensuring that passwords are difficult, if not impossible to reverse engineer. To meet the second criteria, all implementations of the password generator ask users for characters to include in the password without specifying a number of a given character type or guaranteeing that a character type will be included in the final product. Instead, users are encouraged to regenerate a password with the same parameters until a password is generated that they find acceptable. This also add the benefit of encouraging users to generate more passwords as opposed to utilizing their first choice, and obfuscates attempts at guessing what the password may be. The final results of the password manager may produce results that are somewhat unexpected with respect to a user's initial choices but reflect my values in password generation most effectively.</p><p>I found that in the creation of the password generator which I named \"Passmaker\" there were a number of aesthetic and design decisions that I made to ensure that the program would be available to a large number of users. They include but are not limited to 1) Building a CLI so that the program may be used on Linux, MacOS, and Windows. 2) Reducing the program size a single file with a minimum number of dependencies to increase performance. 3) Ensuring the functions are no more than polynomial time. 4) Attempting a functional approach to software creation to further limit the use of storage and system resources. 5) Publishing the repository to <a href=\"https://github.com/Trevor-Opiyo\">My GitHub</a>, so that other developers would be able to follow along in the software's development and audit the code themselves.</p><p>My encouragement to anybody remotely interested in the project and its development is to read the source code for the individual implementations, and clone a copy of the project to use themselves. The rust implementation has been <a href=\"https://crates.io/crates/rust-passmaker\">published</a> as a crate on <a href=\"https://crates.io\">crates.io</a> and may be compiled from source via <a href=\"https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/index.html\">cargo</a> if you have the rust programming language installed. This is my preferred method and the installation command is below.</p><p><code>cargo install rust-passmaker</code></p>"

It has become apparent to me that I needed a website for a few months now, but the infrastructure that I needed to build the site has only recently become available. There are three types of professional development in the computer science industry; networking, skills and accomplishments, and traditional professionalism. On my website, My LinkedIn represents my networking profile, my Github displays my general skills and accomplishments, and my Resume provides a traditional way to show my accomplishments. My hope is that this website will grow alongside my career and give me a way to reflect on my accomplishments thus far.</p><h3 id=\"inspiration\">Inspiration</h3><p><a href=\"https://marco.org\" title=\"Marco Arment&#39;s Website\">marco.org</a> and <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net\" title=\"Dave Gruber&#39;s Website\">daringfireball.net</a> both served as inspiration when creating my website. Both of these websites are well designed and give good insight in their respective developers. The websites are both <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_web_page\" title=\"Static webpage Wikipedia Article\">static</a>, meaning that they are organized as a system of HTML and CSS files. These websites include little to no JavaScript and are not web apps. These websites run in every browser and are extremely light on system resources. I wanted to emulate this minimalistic approach to web design in my own website, which led to a number of benefits. My entire website is hosted and visible on <a href=\"https://github.com/Trevor-Opiyo/Trevor-Opiyo.github.io\" title=\"Trevor Opiyo&#39;s Website Repository on GitHub\">my GitHub repo</a> and as changes are made to my website they are visible in my GitHub. Developers in the future can use the website as a reference, or even download the webpage to be viewed offline. All of these features made a static in the style of the two mentioned above the most obvious choice when designing my website.</p><h3 id=\"hosting\">Hosting</h3><p>I settled on <a href=\"https://pages.cloudflare.com\" title=\"Cloudflare Pages Website\">Cloudflare Pages</a> as my web hosting provider. Cloudflare provides a few features that place it above the competition with the most notable being built in security. Cloudflare pages comes with the ability to dictate connection types (SSL/TLS), the ability to mitigate DDOS attacks, and generally survey web analytics. This allows me to monitor my website for attacks and ensure a safe connection for people who view my site. Cloudflare also provides the ability to register domain names and deploy changes to my website from my GitHub repository automatically. This flexibility abstracts away many elements of the web development process while still providing security and a simple interface for deploying my site.</p><h3 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h3><p>I am very happy with the tools I chose to implement my website. The simple static nature of my website means that my website is accessible, loads quickly, and is easily and widely available. The Hosting provided by Cloudflare ensures entry level security and abstracts away the finicky details of server maintenance and website deployment. The inclusion of a <a href=\"https://github.com/Trevor-Opiyo/Trevor-Opiyo.github.io\" title=\"Trevor Opiyo&#39;s Website Repository on GitHub\">GitHub Repository</a> makes it easier to track changes in my website and serves as a resource for myself and future developers.</p>"
