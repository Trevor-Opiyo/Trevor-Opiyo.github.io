  <h3>Passmaker</h3>
  <p class="style">
    In May of 2018, Twitter disclosed its
    <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/3/17316684/twitter-password-bug-security-flaw-exposed-change-now" rel="prefetch">largest data breach</a>. Twitter exposed user data in plaintext, an indiscretion that prompted me
    to conduct my own password security audit. At the time, I stored my
    passwords in my mind, a place more secure than a plaintext document but
    conducive to passwords that were short and often reused. Twitter's data
    breach led me down a rabbit hole into the world of password managers and
    encouraged me to develop a bespoke solution for generating long, future
    proof passwords.
    <br />
    <br />
    Bitwarden distinguished itself from other password managers with cross
    platform availability and an emphasis on security beyond that of its
    competitors. Bitwarden reinforced their dedication to security by offering
    <a href="https://bitwarden.com/products" rel="prefetch">AES 256 bit encryption </a> and
    conducting
    <a href="https://bitwarden.com/products" rel="prefetch">third party security audits</a>.
    Bitwarden's functionality extends to users of all platforms and skill levels
    and in turn solidifies itself as a viable solution for most users. Bitwarden
    is available on MacOS, Windows, Linux, iOS, Android, the terminal, and via
    browser extension for Safari, Firefox, Edge, and all chrome based browsers.
    Everyone from the Linux system administrator running a locally hosted
    implementation of the Bitwarden cli to the Chromebook user may use Bitwarden
    to store passwords with confidence. This confidence served as my motivation
    to do the same.
    <br />
    <br />
    Bitwarden's password storage left nothing to be desired, but a flaw in its
    password generator presented me with an opportunity. Bitwarden limits
    generated passwords to 20 characters, which may be sufficient for the
    current computer landscape but will render the service ineffective in the
    near future. As computers advance in processing power, they lower the
    execution time of a simple a brute force attack. Shorter passwords become
    particularly susceptible to theft with the only deterrence being longer
    passwords in the present. It was with this knowledge that I designed my own
    password generator Passmaker. Passmaker gave me the opportunity to design a
    password generator with an uncapped character limit and learn more about the
    syntax and standard libraries of

    <a href="https://gitlab.com/trevoropiyo/swift-passmaker" rel="prefetch">Swift</a>. I
    published the resulting programs to my
    <a href="https://gitlab.com/trevoropiyo" rel="prefetch">Gitlab</a> so that future
    developers would be able to extend my solutions and improve their own
    password security.
